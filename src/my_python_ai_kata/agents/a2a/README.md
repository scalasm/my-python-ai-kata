# Agents with A2A SDK

This is set of agents using the [A2A SDK Tutorial](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/tutorials/python).

I have followed the tutorial and created some testbed applications in this package: you can refer to the launch configs in `launch.json` for more details about how to start them, or just use the command line.

## HelloWorld

- [server](./server.py) application is provided to create a standalone application
- [client](./client.py) a simple client is provided for fetching the AgentCard, and then send a simple message, receiving the answer.

No model required!
