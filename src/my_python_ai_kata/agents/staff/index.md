# School Staff 

This is a collection of specialized agents for a school staff.

It is based on the [Amazon Strands Multi-Agent example](https://github.com/strands-agents/docs/blob/main/docs/examples/python/multi_agent_example/index.md), which has been adapted to my needs.

The idea is to have to enough agents for playing with multi-agent workflows.
